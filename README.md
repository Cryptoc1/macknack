# mac-knack
mac-knack is a simple node script for finding Networking card vendors, based off of the first three "sets" of a MAC address. 

### Acknowledgments
The MAC Address:Vendor “database” was built from the list provided in the program `macchanger` for linux. Full credit for the creation of the list goes to those responsible for its integration into `macchanger`.
